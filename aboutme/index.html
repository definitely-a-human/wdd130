    <h2>Mike Kaliski</h2>
    <p>Hello, everyone, I am Mike, I am 29 years old from Mesa Arizona. I am a new member who was baptized last September and just got married to the most amazing person last month. We are both preparing to be sealed in the temple soon.</p>
    <p>I currently work in manufacturing, programming robots to interact with CNC machinery and other equipment in order to produce parts of various materials for various medical and industrial applications.</p>
    <p>There are many things I can see myself doing with what I learn from this course and with web development in my life. From making money on the side to something that helps me create a very professional online portfolio to something that helps me start and grow a personal business. The possiblities are endless.</p>
