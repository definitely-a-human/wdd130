      <!-- --------Content Section -------------- -->
      <hr>
      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage will be the main directory to all of the info on the site, essentially. There will probably be most of the actual written content on this page. Thats what kind of makes this content section of the assignment tough. Most of my site is based on a calander that serves as a visual aide to upcoming video game releases with links as well as some big game news/updates, and a rundown of current game deals with links to stores for purchase. This site will be continuously updated with new games coming into the calendar and current game deals that are ever-changing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The homepage will serve 2 purposes:
      </p>
      <p>
        The first will be to welcome the audience with a very brief slogan or sentance that describes our purpose. I'd like to have a hero box with a message like "Sign up for the Grasshopper Games newsletter to stay up to date on all of the current and upcoming videogame releases and sales." With a place for the user to input their email and click "Sign Up"
      </p>
      <p>
        Following that, I'll have some current video game news only really about the bigger AAA titles that everyone is waiting on. Content placed here would be something like an upcoming release being postponed with some info why or a quick blurb about a big sale on an online market (holiday sale info, flash sale, publisher sale, etc.). I also do play enough games to quite possibly write my own little preview of a game for those who might be interested.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Release Calendar</h3>
      <p>
        The content on this page is going to largely made up of a calander with videogame release dates and links to the publisher page for more info and to stores to preorder or buy the game spanning the previous month current, month, and two upcoming months.
      </p>
      <p>
        The calander will show pictures of the coverart for the biggest games on the calander that will change as months get updated
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Current Game Deals</h3>
      <p>
        The content for this page is going to be 4 lists of links to current digital store sales and physical store sale information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 4 lists are:
      </p>
      <p>
        A list of PC game sales links on Steam (Largest digital PC videogame storefront)
      </p>
      <p>
        A list of PlayStation sale links on the PS Store
      </p>
      <p>
        A list of XBox sale links on the Microsoft Storefront
      </p>
      <p>
        A list of Nintendo sale links on the Nintendo eShop
      </p>
      <p>
        Photos for this page will be the store front logos as well as some game cover arts for the more popular games.
